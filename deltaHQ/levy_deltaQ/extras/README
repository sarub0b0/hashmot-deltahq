Extra tools for QOMET
=====================

run_experiment.sh
-----------------
Run an emulation experiment. Various parameters must be provided, as shown in 
the examples test_local-dl.sh, test_local-bw.sh, etc.

The experiments make use of the tools "ping" and "iperf" which must be
installed in advance. The path to iperf can be configured in the
script in order to make possible using a particular version.

The experiment also uses "sudo", which must be installed and
configured to _not_ require a password for the user running the
experiment. This can be achieved by modifying /etc/sudoers similarly
to the following line:
   <user_name>   ALL=(ALL)   NOPASSWD: ALL

test_local-XX.sh
-------------------------
Run a local experiment. XX can be either "bw" for badwidth
experiments, or "dl" for delay and loss experiments. 

Note that these experiments must be run on a PC on which ipfw3 as well
as QOMET is installed. See the scripts for more details.

test_2_hosts-XX.sh
-------------------------
Run an experiment on 2 hosts. XX can be either "bw" for badwidth
experiments, or "dl" for delay and loss experiments. 

Note that these experiments must be started from a PC on that can
connect via ssh without password to the experiment hosts on which
which the experiments is effectively run, which also should have ipfw3
as well as QOMET is installed. See the scripts for more details.

show_bin
--------
Show the contents of a QOMET binary output file.
