Overview
========

The timer library is used to time the periodic execution of updates of
the network configuration by QOMET programs such as do_wireconf.

To compile the library, use the command "make".

For an usage example of the library, see the file "test_timer.c".
This program also serves as a validation tools for the library.
Executing "test_timer" will display the expected and actual durations
of a test, and report a warning in case they differ by more than a
predefined threshold. Feel free to change the parameter values in
"test_timer.c" in order to various conditions.
